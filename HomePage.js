As a SovTech Developer I will be exposed to project diversity and get an opportunity to take on real responsibility as a Software Developer. I believe that SovTech will develop me as a future leader of the business and industry altogether.

Lastly, as this program will be a practical, mentored, hands-on first-job environment, it will be highly beneficial to me as I will be taught the foundations of the Tech Industry and how to effectively use and grow my skills.</p>
